- __Conquer the Gotchas__

No matter your level of experience, it's simply impossible to know everything there is to know about web development. Luckily, there _are_ some things you can keep an eye out for that will make your workflow more seamless and less stressful.

- __The Beginning of the End of CSS__
  - led by: Vince Speelman
  - abstract: No matter how hard you may try, you're going to end up running into your favortie language, CSS. The good news is that it can be a lot simpler than the stylesheet bourgeoisie make it out to be. By employing functional programming techniques, you can simplify your stylesheets, work with confidence, and never write CSS again.
